Space ship games:
memory restriction:
1. SoC: ~3MB
2. Avalon register: 32 bit x 16  = 512 bit total.

object:
1. player plane ( 20 wide x 24 high or 480 pixels)
2. npc plane
3. player bullet
4. npc bullet

backgournd:
1. Scrolling, 640 wide x 480 high(307,200 pixels, 307.2 KB(if 1 byte of data per pixel) or 921.6KB(if 3 byte of data per pixel)) 

controls:
1. keyboard(arrow keys or wasd keys) controls the direction of the player plane.
2. button set to shoot.

Interaction:
1. when player bullet touches npc plane, disappear.
2. when npc bullet touches player plane, disappear, game over.

Game state FSM:
1. Game Initial: welcome screen, press any key to start game to enter next state.
2. Game start: actual game play.
3. Game done: either success or fail. and go to exit to Initial or restart to game start.

detail for Game start state:
1. game state for each object.
2. score keeping


Data need to be keep track:
1. location of player plane.(10 bit x direction and 9 bit y direction)
2. location of npc plane. ( 10 bit x direction and 9 bit y direction)
3. player bullet. ( 10 bit and 9 bit) for each bullet.
    - problem could be too much bullet to keep track of,
        ` set limit on max bullets, or laser so have a vertical line instead of individual bullet.
4. npc bullet. ( 10 bit and 9 bit) for each bullet - might not do this due to memory constraint.
